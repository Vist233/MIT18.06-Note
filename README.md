# MIT18.06-note-
2023上半年学期作
笔记分为3部分：
1. *MIT18.06*为听原课程所作
2. *线性代数的本质-3b1b's course*为听3blue1brown的线性代数的本质所作
3. *线性代数的课程*为自己在创作时间的学期听老师讲课所作

此笔记是大一学生第一次创作，仅仅是为自己所做。如若对大家有参考价值欢迎参考。
另附其他创作者的笔记：https://github.com/MLNLP-World/MIT-Linear-Algebra-Notes
感谢他的笔记，使得在我学习的路线少了一份坎坷，也让我萌生了这个project的念头。
如有做的不好，请大家指正。


Title: Notes for the First Half of 2023 Semester

These notes are divided into three sections:
1. *MIT 18.06*: Notes from attending the original course
2. *Essence of Linear Algebra - 3Blue1Brown's course*: Notes from watching 3Blue1Brown's Essence of Linear Algebra series
3. *Linear Algebra Course*: Notes from attending lectures by my own teacher during the semester

These notes are the first attempt by a freshman student and were made solely for personal use. If they are helpful to others, you are welcome to refer to them. 

Here is a link to notes from other contributors: [https://github.com/MLNLP-World/MIT-Linear-Algebra-Notes](https://github.com/MLNLP-World/MIT-Linear-Algebra-Notes)

I would like to express my gratitude to the author of those notes, as they have smoothed my learning journey and inspired me to undertake this project. If there are any areas that need improvement, I would appreciate your feedback.
