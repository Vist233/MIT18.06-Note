# MIT18.06 Notes

## Introduction

Welcome to the notes for the first half of the 2023 semester. This repository contains comprehensive notes on linear algebra, divided into three main sections. These notes are the result of a freshman student's first attempt at creating a structured learning resource. They are primarily intended for personal use, but if you find them helpful, feel free to refer to them.

## Sections

### 1. MIT 18.06

This section contains notes from attending the original MIT 18.06 course on linear algebra. The course covers fundamental concepts and techniques in linear algebra, including:

- Systems of linear equations
- Matrix algebra
- Vector spaces
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Orthogonality and least squares

### 2. Essence of Linear Algebra - 3Blue1Brown's Course

This section includes notes from watching 3Blue1Brown's "Essence of Linear Algebra" series. This series is known for its intuitive and visual approach to explaining linear algebra concepts. Topics covered include:

- Vectors and spaces
- Linear transformations
- Matrix multiplication
- Determinants and eigenvalues
- Change of basis

### 3. Linear Algebra Course

This section consists of notes from attending lectures by my own teacher during the semester. These notes provide a different perspective and additional insights into the topics covered in the other sections. Key topics include:

- Vector spaces and subspaces
- Linear independence
- Basis and dimension
- Inner product spaces
- Diagonalization

## Additional Resources

In addition to the notes provided in this repository, I highly recommend checking out notes from other contributors. One such resource is available at [MIT-Linear-Algebra-Notes](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/86138/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html). These notes have been incredibly helpful in my own learning journey and have inspired me to create this project.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to the author of the notes linked above. Their work has significantly smoothed my learning path and motivated me to compile my own notes. If you find any areas that need improvement or have any feedback, please feel free to reach out. Your suggestions are highly appreciated.

## How to Use This Repository

To get the most out of these notes, I recommend the following approach:

1. **Start with the MIT 18.06 section**: This will give you a solid foundation in linear algebra.
2. **Watch 3Blue1Brown's series**: Use the notes in the "Essence of Linear Algebra" section to reinforce and visualize the concepts.
3. **Refer to the Linear Algebra Course section**: Use these notes to gain additional insights and perspectives from my own lectures.
